There is a noticeable increase in the average selling price across almost all brands starting from the early 2010s. This suggests a general rise in car prices, possibly due to advancements in technology, added features, or inflation.
Some brands, such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz, show a sharper increase in average selling prices compared to others, indicating a focus on premium, high-cost models.

**2. Average Selling Price by Brand:**

Lexus, Land Rover, and Jaguar are among the brands with the highest average selling prices, suggesting these brands are positioned in the luxury market.
Maruti, Hyundai, and Tata have relatively lower average selling prices, which could indicate their strong presence in the mass-market segment, targeting budget-conscious consumers.

**3. Average Selling Price by Brand and Transmission Type:**

The chart shows that for most brands, cars with automatic transmissions have a higher average selling price compared to manual transmissions. This reflects the higher cost associated with automatic technology and possibly consumer preference for convenience.
